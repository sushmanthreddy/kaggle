# kaggle
I am completely new to this deep learning,started with some of
mit opencourseware but nothing was worth taking ,because 
everything what i learnt couldnt implement in correct way.

so i started working on some datasets on kaggle my first dataset 
was titanic dataset and next ,started with MNIST dataset 

## 1. TITANIC DATASET:
   Here in this dataset ,there is compplete data of people who travelled in the titanic 
   we need to predict people who were alive after the titanic incident , so we have train our model in such way that it predicts 
   the people who were alive and who were dead?
## 2. MNIST DATASET:
