# kaggle
I am completely new to this deep learning,started with some of
mit opencourseware but nothing was worth taking ,because 
everything what i learnt couldnt implement in correct way.

so i started working on some datasets on kaggle my first dataset 
was titanic dataset and next ,started with MNIST dataset 

## 1. TITANIC DATASET:

   Here in this dataset ,there is compplete data of people who travelled in the titanic 
   we need to predict people who were alive after the titanic incident , so we have train our model in such way that it predicts 
   the people who were alive and who were dead?
## 2. MNIST DATASET:

   Here in this dataset we contain 70000 handwritten digits we train our model with 60000 handwritten digits and another 10000 were used for the
   testing the model and in my model is trained with only 50000 and another 10000 is used for validation of model and here we are getting an accuracy 85
   percent and ,I have completely implemented using pytorch and matlib
